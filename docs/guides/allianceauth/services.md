## Mumble and Discord

In order to gain access and roles to our Mumble and Discord servers you must activate the sevices on the site. Mumble is mandatory per alliance policy, but Discord is optional.

Click the services button on your dashboard or got to [https://onyxfed.space/services](https://onyxfed.space/services).

## Mumble

Mumble will create a username and password for you to use when setting up your Mumble sever. The username needs to be exactly what is generated for you. Hit the continue button to create the account.

To change your password hit the yellow pencil box and change it to whatever you want. Should you forget your mumble password at anytime, you can come back here to change it again.

For detailed instruction on setting up Mumble and the server, go to [Mumble Page]

## Discord

Discord is fairly simple to set up, but can be a little tricky when getting roles on the server.

!!! warning

    If you are already on the server for Onyx Federation, it is suggested that you leave it before performing the steps below as it may not always give you proper roles.

Discord will redirect you to the server authorization page automatically to get you setup as well as join the server for you. Hit the authorize button.

Once you do that it will assign your roles for your account. That's pretty much it.

### Discord Troubleshooting

#### It didn't give me roles

Go ahead and hit the grey refresh button on the services page where you activated discord.

#### Still not working

Leave the discord server completley, go back to the services page and hit the red x button, try again.

#### I give up
