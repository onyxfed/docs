# Welcome to Onyx Federation Services

This site is intended to help you better understand how to gain access and use alliance services. The process is fairly simple, but it is always easier with pictures. 

!!! info "Contributing to Documentation"
    
    Great software is coupled with even greater documentation. If you would like to contribute to making this 
    documentation even better, please don't hesitate to fork the 
    [documentation repository](https://github.com/eveseat/docs) and submit a pull request with your contribution. 
    We are always looking for better information.
